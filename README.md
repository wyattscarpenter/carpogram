Include a character like ) (but smaller?) to be used in smiley faces like :) without messing up nesting parens its found in?

iso basic Latin

ASCII punctuation

normal punctuation

combining italicizer, boldizer, superscriptizer (this one can stack, to make 2^2^2), subscriptizer (same), strikethough (also stacks, to get, like, ¥ (bad example, but if you imagine a double-crossed out letter)), underline (distinct from underscore) (stacks), overline (distinct from overscore(??)) (stacks), sans-serif, monospace, blackletter (including the variation selector for the style of black letter fractor versus round hand I think), small caps izer. big smalls izer? (probably not)

oh yeah, also, There are only lower case base letters and then there's a combining capitalizor. I guess this doesn't stack.

combining combinizer for o^(that) = ô. (oh yes this is also specifically combining over, because you could also put things under etc)

maybe ø is just o/(combining combinizer)

possibly a combining variation selectionizer, which is used with a hex digit?

possibly a combining tagizer?

I have also joked about adding the chess characters, possibly with a black square and then using the combining combinizer on that to color them. and maybe the integral symbol.

I would add the android blob emojis if I could, but that seems out-of-scope.
